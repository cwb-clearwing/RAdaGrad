# CIFAR10-VGG16

## Description

This project classifies the CIFAR-10 dataset using the VGG16 architecture with three different optimizers:

- **RAdaGrad**
- **RGD**
- **DLRT**

---

## Files

- `train_RAdaGrad_VGG16.py`: Experiments with the RAdaGrad optimizer.
- `train_RGD_VGG16.py`: Experiments with the RGD optimizer.
- `train_DLRT_VGG16.py`: Experiments with the DLRT optimizer.

---

## How to Obtain the Results

The results are stored in the following folders:

- `results_RAdaGrad_VGG16`: Contains results for the RAdaGrad optimizer.
- `results_RGD_VGG16`: Contains results for the RGD optimizer.
- `results_DLRT_VGG16`: Contains results for the DLRT optimizer.

Each folder contains the output data for the corresponding optimizer.
